Static vs Dynamic Linking
------------------------------------------------
Static linking libraries - the application uses it's own libraries, but  it is becoming larger in size
Dynamic Linking 		-- the applications uses shared common libraries, thus they are smaller in size, but has dependencies

!Problem One: hard to manage all files and locations, update and keep track of changes
!Problem Two: More Spice & No dependency OR Less Space & Dependency Hell

ldd /bin/ls				-- print shared object dependencies

Packages and Packaging Systems
------------------------------------------------
- dependency tracking
- easier installation and update
Two main and widespread formats
- rpm - Red Hat packages
- deb - Debian packages
Packages are available
- locally as individual files
- through local or remote repositories

Packets can be:
- source and binary
- full, patch and delta
Packets consist of:
- compressed binary files
- name and version of the packages's software
- build date and host on which it was built
- description of the package and its purpose
- checksums and dependencies required

RPM
------------------------------------------------
RPM stands for:
- Package format
- Package database
- Package management tool
with rpm we can install, update and remove local packages

data is located in /var/lib/rpm
in case of corruption it can be fixed by the root
rpm --rebuilddb
*only one user can access the database at a time
* it is implemented .var/lib/rpm/.rpm.lock

rpm -qa					-- query of all installed packages
rpm -q [package name]	--query a specific installed package
rpm -qip [package name].rpm	-- query local, but not installed package
rpm -ql [package name]	-- list all files in a package
rpm -qf [file path]		-- query for file dependency
rpm -qc [package name]	-- find package configuration files
rpm -ivh [package name].rpm		-- install specific package

Package management are in low and higher level as high level repositories are:
- Fedora family is using YUM(getting older) and DNF(newer)
- Open Suse family is using Zypper


Dpkg is the Debian's management tool
with dpkg we can install, update and remove local packages
For higher level of repositories - searching and downloading:
- Pure text based - APT tools
- Pseudo graphical - aptitude
- Graphical - synaptic
