WSL is an optional feature in Windows 10
We can run Ubuntu, Fedora and openSUSE on Windows using WSL feature, and more Linux distributions coming soon.
!This feature is not working on 32-bit version on Windows 10, so ensure you're using the 64-bit version of Windows.
Advantage: We can access Windows files in bash, and Bash files in Windows.

Start -> Turn Windows features on and off --> Windows Subsystem for Linux -->restart

From Microsoft store --> install chosen distribution

From start --> it will give you the distribution terminal

Enter user and password

You are GOOD to go!
