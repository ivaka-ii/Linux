=======================================
Network use case 
=======================================
Client or server problem
------------------------
If there is not connection from one server(dev1) to another (web1) we can try 
to troubleshoot connection from different server on same network (dev2) to web 1.

Is It Plugged In?
------------------------
We can verify that the dev1 has a healthy connection using tool such as ethtool
-check network interfaces with ifconfig

-run cmd $sudo ethtool [network interface]

$ sudo ethtool eth0
Settings for eth0:
     Supported ports: [ TP ]
     Supported link modes:   10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full
                               100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full
                               1000baseT/Half 1000baseT/Full
     Supports auto-negotiation: Yes
     Advertised link modes:  10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full
                               100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full
                               1000baseT/Half 1000baseT/Full
     Advertised auto-negotiation: Yes
     Speed: 100Mb/s
     Duplex: Full
     Port: Twisted Pair
     PHYAD: 0
     Transceiver: internal
     Auto-negotiation: on
     Supports Wake-on: pg
     Wake-on: d
     Current message level: 0x000000ff (255)
     Link detected: yes
	 
If Link detected: yes - the link is physically connected to the network.
if it is no - we should physically inspect dev1's network connection
